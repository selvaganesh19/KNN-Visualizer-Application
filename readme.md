# KNN-Visualizer-Application 🎯

Welcome to **KNN-Visualizer-Application**! This project provides an intuitive interface for exploring and visualizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm. Whether you're learning machine learning or want to experiment with KNN parameters, this application makes it easy to see how KNN works in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Introduction

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, yet powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. The **KNN-Visualizer-Application** leverages Python, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Gradio to let users:

- Interactively adjust KNN parameters
- Visualize decision boundaries
- Analyze model accuracy
- Work with popular datasets like Iris

---

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive UI**: Powered by Gradio for easy parameter tuning and visualization.
- **Dataset Selection**: Built-in support for classic datasets (e.g., Iris).
- **Parameter Control**: Change the number of neighbors, test/train split, and more.
- **Visualization**: View decision boundaries and classifier outputs.
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Instantly see model performance.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/selvaganesh19/KNN-Visualizer-Application.git
   cd KNN-Visualizer-Application
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If `requirements.txt` is not available, install manually:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn gradio
   ```

## 📈 Usage

1. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. **Open the Gradio interface:**
   - A local URL will be displayed in your terminal.
   - Open it in your browser to interact with the KNN visualizer.

3. **Experiment:**
   - Select dataset, adjust the number of neighbors (`k`), and split ratio.
   - View the resulting decision boundary and model accuracy.
